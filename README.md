## Assessing the Impact of Non-resident Fungi on the Human Gut Mycobiome in Health and Disease
This repository serves as the **Appendix** for the MSc thesis written by Chumei Tang in September 2024.

### Repository Structure

- [**src-analysis/**](./src-analysis/)  
  Contains scripts used for processing and analyzing human gut mycobiome sequencing data and associated sample metadata.
  
- [**data/**](./data/)  
  Contains metadata used in the analyses, along with result summaries and statistical tables (TSV/Excel files) generated from the analyses. Note that many Qiime 2 artifacts exceed GitHub's file size limits and are therefore not included.

- [**plots/**](./plots/)  
  Contains visualizations generated from the analyses, including key figures presented in the thesis and additional supplementary plots.

- [**src-plots/**](./src-plots/)  
  Contains scripts for generating the visualizations found in the `plots/` folder.
